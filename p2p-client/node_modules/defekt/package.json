  "readme": "# defekt\n\ndefekt is custom errors made simple.\n\n![defekt](https://github.com/thenativeweb/defekt/raw/master/images/logo.jpg \"defekt\")\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install defekt\n\n## Quick start\n\nFirst you need to add a reference to defekt in your application.\n\n```javascript\nvar defekt = require('defekt');\n```\n\nThen call the `defekt` function and hand over an array of custom error names that you would like to have created.\n\n```javascript\nvar errors = defekt([\n  'ArgumentNull',\n  'InvalidOperation',\n  '...'\n]);\n```\n\nThe result is an object containing all the errors you specified. To use one of those errors, simply call the appropriate function with `new` and throw it.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new errors.InvalidOperation();\n```\n\nIf you want to specify a message, feel free to do so.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new errors.InvalidOperation('Something failed.');\n```\n\nAdditionally, if an error was caused by another error, you can specify this error as the second parameter.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new errors.InvalidOperation('Something failed.', new Error(...));\n```\n\nThe custom errors follow the same rules as the built-in ones, i.e. they have a `name` and a `message` property, they derive from `Error` and they can be recognized by the `util.isError` function.\n\n## Running the build\n\nThis module can be built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Besides running the tests, this also analyses the code. To run Grunt, go to the folder where you have installed defekt and run `grunt`. You need to have [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) installed.\n\n    $ grunt\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2015 the native web.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
